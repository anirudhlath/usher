# CLAUDE.md

## What this is

**Usher** — a self-hosted media catalog backend that abstracts media servers
(Emby first) behind its own canonical database, with search, similarity, and
LLM-curated recommendation rows. MIT licensed. Python 3.13 / FastAPI /
PostgreSQL.

**Status: pre-implementation.** This repository contains design documentation
only — no source, no build, no tests yet. Do not invent commands for tooling
that does not exist.

## Keep the PRD current

`docs/prd/` is the authoritative, living description of what Usher is and why.
Code that contradicts it is a bug in one of them — resolve it, never let it
drift silently.

**Update the PRD in the same commit as the change that invalidates it.** Not in
a follow-up, not "later". A change that alters behaviour and leaves the PRD
stale is incomplete.

Start at `docs/prd/README.md` for the index. Detailed maintenance conventions
load automatically when working in `docs/`.

## Conventions that will bite you

- **Ports are `abc.ABC`, not `typing.Protocol`.** Deliberate — see
  [ADR-0001](docs/prd/decisions/0001-abc-over-protocol.md). Do not "modernise"
  them to Protocols.
- **Layering is enforced, not advisory.** `domain/` imports nothing from
  `adapters/`, `db/`, or `api/`; `services/` depends only on `domain/` and
  `ports/`. CI checks this with `import-linter`.
- **No source-specific concept escapes its adapter.** If something only makes
  sense for Emby, it belongs in `adapters/emby/` or on `MediaItem` — never on
  `Title`, never in an API response.
- **Identity is our UUIDv7.** `tmdb_id`/`imdb_id` are indexed attributes, never
  primary keys, never identifiers in an API contract.
- **Ship importers, never data.** No third-party metadata may be committed or
  included in a release artifact — IMDb and TMDb both prohibit redistribution.
  Users run importers and hold their own API keys. Attribution strings stay in
  the API surface.
- **Use `uv`** for all Python work: `uv sync`, `uv run <cmd>`, `uv add <pkg>`.
  Never pip/conda, never activate a venv.
- **TDD.** Failing test first, then implementation.

## Known open risk

Emby's WebSocket handshake against the target server returns **HTTP 101** — the
proxy forwards upgrades. (An earlier 404 was a malformed-probe artifact; that
finding was wrong.) Not yet confirmed end to end: a control handshake against
`/` also returns 101, so message-level verification with a live token is still
outstanding. Detail and fallbacks:
[ADR-0004](docs/prd/decisions/0004-push-over-polling.md).

## Commands

None yet — no code exists. When the project is scaffolded (milestone M1), add
the real `uv` commands here and delete this note.
