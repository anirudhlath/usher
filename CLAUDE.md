## What this is

**Usher** — a self-hosted media catalog backend that abstracts media servers
(Emby first) behind its own canonical database, with search, similarity, and
LLM-curated recommendation rows. MIT licensed. Python 3.13 / FastAPI /
PostgreSQL.

**Status: M1 foundation in progress.** The project scaffold and environment
config exist (`pyproject.toml`, `src/usher/config.py`, `tests/unit/`); domain
models, ports, persistence, the API, telemetry, and containerization are not
yet built. See `docs/plans/2026-07-28-m1-foundation.md` for the task
breakdown. Do not invent commands for tooling that does not exist yet — check
the Commands section below before assuming something runs.

## Keep the PRD current

`docs/prd/` is the authoritative, living description of what Usher is and why.
Code that contradicts it is a bug in one of them — resolve it, never let it
drift silently.

**Update the PRD in the same commit as the change that invalidates it.** Not in
a follow-up, not "later". A change that alters behaviour and leaves the PRD
stale is incomplete.

Start at `docs/prd/README.md` for the index. Detailed maintenance conventions
load automatically when working in `docs/`.

## Conventions that will bite you

- **Ports are `abc.ABC`, not `typing.Protocol`.** Deliberate — see
  [ADR-0001](docs/prd/decisions/0001-abc-over-protocol.md). Do not "modernise"
  them to Protocols.
- **Layering is enforced, not advisory.** `domain/` imports nothing from
  `adapters/`, `db/`, or `api/`; `services/` depends only on `domain/` and
  `ports/`. CI checks this with `import-linter`.
- **No source-specific concept escapes its adapter.** If something only makes
  sense for Emby, it belongs in `adapters/emby/` or on `MediaItem` — never on
  `Title`, never in an API response.
- **Identity is our UUIDv7.** `tmdb_id`/`imdb_id` are indexed attributes, never
  primary keys, never identifiers in an API contract.
- **Domain models are frozen — use `.evolve()`, never `model_copy(update=)`.**
  Every `usher.domain` model inherits `DomainModel`
  (`src/usher/domain/base.py`), so `model_copy(update=...)` is reachable on
  all of them but skips validation entirely: it can hand back an instance
  with a wrong-typed or out-of-range field that pydantic still serializes
  without complaint. `.evolve(**changes)` re-validates from scratch and is
  the only sanctioned write path.
- **Ship importers, never data.** No third-party metadata may be committed or
  included in a release artifact — IMDb and TMDb both prohibit redistribution.
  Users run importers and hold their own API keys. Attribution strings stay in
  the API surface.
- **Use `uv`** for all Python work: `uv sync`, `uv run <cmd>`, `uv add <pkg>`.
  Never pip/conda, never activate a venv.
- **TDD.** Failing test first, then implementation.
- **Secrets in `Settings` are `pydantic.SecretStr`**, never plain `str` —
  `database_url`, `secret_key`, `tmdb_api_key`. Unwrap with
  `.get_secret_value()` only at the point of use (e.g. handing a DSN to
  `create_async_engine`); never store the unwrapped value in a variable that
  outlives that call, and never let it reach a log line or an exception
  message. This is how `docs/prd/08-operations.md`'s "credentials are never
  logged" rule is enforced rather than merely asserted.

## Verified facts worth not re-deriving

**Emby push works.** Verified 2026-07-29 against the live server with a normal
non-admin token: `/embywebsocket` upgrades (101), delivers periodic `Sessions`,
and pushes `UserDataChanged` within seconds of an out-of-band state change. Two
earlier negative findings were both wrong — see
[ADR-0004](docs/prd/decisions/0004-push-over-polling.md).

Health-check caveat: a handshake against *any* path succeeds, so a successful
upgrade is not a health signal. Assert on received messages instead.

## Commands

Verified working as of Group A (scaffold + config):

```bash
uv sync                          # install dependencies
uv run pytest                    # run the test suite (unit tests only so far)
uv run pytest tests/unit         # fast unit tests only
uv run ruff check .              # lint — clean
uv run ruff format .             # format — clean
uv run mypy                      # type check, strict mode — clean
uv run lint-imports              # enforce architecture contracts — 4 kept, 0 broken
```

`[tool.ruff] extend-exclude = ["docs"]` keeps ruff off `docs/plans/*.md` and
`docs/prd/*.md` — ruff 0.16+ formats/lints Python code fences embedded in
Markdown by default, and those two directories hold planning and PRD prose
with embedded code fences that must stay byte-identical for other groups to
transcribe. Without the exclude, an unscoped `ruff format .` silently
rewrites that prose.

Not yet available — depend on code later M1 groups haven't written:
`uv run alembic revision|upgrade` (needs Group D's migrations),
`docker compose up` (needs Group G's `Dockerfile`/`compose.yml`).
