## What this is

**Usher** — a self-hosted media catalog backend that abstracts media servers
(Emby first) behind its own canonical database, with search, similarity, and
LLM-curated recommendation rows. MIT licensed. Python 3.13 / FastAPI /
PostgreSQL.

**Status: M1 foundation in progress.** The project scaffold, environment
config, domain models, port ABCs, persistence (SQLAlchemy schema + Alembic
migrations + title repository), the telemetry bootstrap, and a FastAPI app
with liveness/readiness endpoints all exist; containerization is not yet
built. See `docs/plans/2026-07-28-m1-foundation.md` for the task breakdown.
Do not invent commands for tooling that does not exist yet — check the
Commands section below before assuming something runs.

## Keep the PRD current

`docs/prd/` is the authoritative, living description of what Usher is and why.
Code that contradicts it is a bug in one of them — resolve it, never let it
drift silently.

**Update the PRD in the same commit as the change that invalidates it.** Not in
a follow-up, not "later". A change that alters behaviour and leaves the PRD
stale is incomplete.

Start at `docs/prd/README.md` for the index. Detailed maintenance conventions
load automatically when working in `docs/`.

## Conventions that will bite you

- **Ports are `abc.ABC`, not `typing.Protocol`.** Deliberate — see
  [ADR-0001](docs/prd/decisions/0001-abc-over-protocol.md). Do not "modernise"
  them to Protocols.
- **Layering is enforced, not advisory.** `domain/` imports nothing from
  `adapters/`, `db/`, or `api/`; `services/` depends only on `domain/` and
  `ports/`. CI checks this with `import-linter`.
- **No source-specific concept escapes its adapter.** If something only makes
  sense for Emby, it belongs in `adapters/emby/` or on `MediaItem` — never on
  `Title`, never in an API response.
- **Identity is our UUIDv7.** `tmdb_id`/`imdb_id` are indexed attributes, never
  primary keys, never identifiers in an API contract.
- **Domain models are frozen — use `.evolve()`, never `model_copy(update=)`.**
  Every `usher.domain` model inherits `DomainModel`
  (`src/usher/domain/base.py`), so `model_copy(update=...)` is reachable on
  all of them but skips validation entirely: it can hand back an instance
  with a wrong-typed or out-of-range field that pydantic still serializes
  without complaint. `.evolve(**changes)` re-validates from scratch and is
  the only sanctioned write path.
- **Ship importers, never data.** No third-party metadata may be committed or
  included in a release artifact — IMDb and TMDb both prohibit redistribution.
  Users run importers and hold their own API keys. Attribution strings stay in
  the API surface.
- **Use `uv`** for all Python work: `uv sync`, `uv run <cmd>`, `uv add <pkg>`.
  Never pip/conda, never activate a venv.
- **TDD.** Failing test first, then implementation.
- **Secrets in `Settings` are `pydantic.SecretStr`**, never plain `str` —
  `database_url`, `secret_key`, `tmdb_api_key`. Unwrap with
  `.get_secret_value()` only at the point of use (e.g. handing a DSN to
  `create_async_engine`); never store the unwrapped value in a variable that
  outlives that call, and never let it reach a log line or an exception
  message. This is how `docs/prd/08-operations.md`'s "credentials are never
  logged" rule is enforced rather than merely asserted.

## Verified facts worth not re-deriving

**Emby push works.** Verified 2026-07-29 against the live server with a normal
non-admin token: `/embywebsocket` upgrades (101), delivers periodic `Sessions`,
and pushes `UserDataChanged` within seconds of an out-of-band state change. Two
earlier negative findings were both wrong — see
[ADR-0004](docs/prd/decisions/0004-push-over-polling.md).

Health-check caveat: a handshake against *any* path succeeds, so a successful
upgrade is not a health signal. Assert on received messages instead.

## Commands

Verified working as of Group A (scaffold + config):

```bash
uv sync                          # install dependencies
uv run pytest                    # run the test suite (now needs Docker — see Group E below)
uv run pytest tests/unit         # fast unit tests only, no Docker required
uv run ruff check .              # lint — clean
uv run ruff format .             # format — clean
uv run mypy                      # type check, strict mode — clean
uv run lint-imports              # enforce architecture contracts — 4 kept, 0 broken
```

`[tool.ruff] extend-exclude = ["docs"]` keeps ruff off `docs/plans/*.md` and
`docs/prd/*.md` — ruff 0.16+ formats/lints Python code fences embedded in
Markdown by default, and those two directories hold planning and PRD prose
with embedded code fences that must stay byte-identical for other groups to
transcribe. Without the exclude, an unscoped `ruff format .` silently
rewrites that prose.

Verified working as of Group D (db engine, models, migrations) — requires a
live Postgres (e.g. `docker run -d -e POSTGRES_USER=usher -e
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=usher -e POSTGRES_DB=usher -p 5432:5432
pgvector/pgvector:pg17`), so not part of the default `uv run pytest` run:

```bash
export USHER_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://usher:usher@localhost:5432/usher"
export USHER_SECRET_KEY="<32+ char secret>"
uv run alembic upgrade head                       # apply migrations
uv run alembic downgrade base                     # reverse them (0001 is fully reversible)
uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "..."    # generate a migration from model changes
```

**`--autogenerate` is blind to two categories of change — verify by eye, not
just by running it:**
- **CHECK constraint bodies.** Changing a bound (e.g. loosening
  `ck_titles_year_non_negative`'s `>= 0`) and running `--autogenerate`
  produces an empty `pass` migration with no warning — verified directly.
  This schema deliberately mirrors every Pydantic field constraint as a
  CHECK, so this will eventually bite: tightening or loosening one in a
  model file does not, by itself, get picked up.
- **Triggers and functions** (the three `set_updated_at()` triggers from
  the first migration). These aren't SQLAlchemy `Table` metadata at all, so
  autogenerate never sees them, in either direction — adding, dropping, or
  changing one is always a hand-written `op.execute(...)` migration.

Verified working as of Group E (title repository, first integration tests) —
`tests/integration/` runs against a real PostgreSQL, started and torn down
per test run by `testcontainers` (`pgvector/pgvector:pg17`; first run pulls
the image, ~625 MB). Docker must be running; nothing else to set up. Its
schema comes from running the real Alembic migration once per test session
(`postgres_url`, `tests/integration/conftest.py`), not `Base.metadata.
create_all` — CHECK constraint bodies and the three `set_updated_at`
triggers are invisible to `create_all` the same way they're invisible to
`--autogenerate` (above), so a suite that never runs the migration can't
catch either drifting from the models. Each test still gets a fully
isolated database via a connection-bound transaction rolled back
afterward, not a schema recreate — cheaper than the 23-tests-worth of
`create_all`/`drop_all` cycles that used to cost, and `tests/integration/
test_migrations.py` is the ongoing regression check (trigger existence,
plus an autogenerate diff against the migrated database asserting no
drift):

```bash
uv run pytest                        # full suite — 235 tests, needs Docker for the 44 under tests/integration/
uv run pytest tests/unit             # 191 tests, no Docker
uv run pytest tests/integration      # 44 tests, needs Docker
uv run pytest -m "not integration"   # marker equivalent of tests/unit
uv run pytest -m integration         # marker equivalent of tests/integration
```

Two ways to select the same split — pick whichever fits: directory (what
Task 10 itself was written and verified against) or the `integration`
marker (registered in `pyproject.toml`, auto-applied to everything under
`tests/integration/` by that directory's `conftest.py`). Both are kept in
sync deliberately, so Group G's CI can use either without the two
diverging. Not wired into `addopts` as a default `-m "not integration"` —
that would make `pytest tests/integration/...` silently collect zero tests
instead of running them.

`tests/contract/title_repository_contract.py` holds the behavioural
assertions every `TitleRepository` implementation must satisfy — the same
suite runs against `FakeTitleRepository` (`tests/unit/`, no Docker) and
`PostgresTitleRepository` (`tests/integration/`, real Postgres), so the two
are verified to actually agree instead of merely looking alike. This is the
pattern PRD 08 calls the "contract suite" for `SourceAdapter`; M3 is
expected to reuse it.

Verified working as of Group F (telemetry bootstrap, FastAPI app with health
endpoints, then hardened in a follow-up review pass) — the app is now a
runnable service:

```bash
export USHER_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://usher:usher@localhost:5432/usher"
export USHER_SECRET_KEY="<32+ char secret>"
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn usher.api.app:create_app --factory --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
curl http://localhost:8000/health          # liveness  -- {"status":"ok"}, HTTP 200 always
curl http://localhost:8000/health/ready    # readiness -- {"status":"ready","checks":{"database":true,"migrations":true}}, HTTP 200 or 503
```

`/health` and `/health/ready` are deliberately different: liveness must never
depend on Postgres (a database outage is not a reason to kill and restart
the process — restarting doesn't fix Postgres), so only readiness executes
`SELECT 1` (and, only if that succeeds, compares the live `alembic_version`
table against `usher.db.migrations.status.code_head_revision()` — PRD 08:
"the app refuses to serve on a schema mismatch rather than guessing").
Readiness returns HTTP 503 (not 200) when any check fails: no PRD text pins
a status code, but a readiness probe's real consumers — Kubernetes, Docker
`healthcheck`, load balancers — gate on the code and never parse the body.
Verified directly against a real container: stopping Postgres mid-session
leaves `/health` returning `{"status":"ok"}`/200 unchanged while
`/health/ready` switches to `{"status":"degraded","checks":{"database":
false,"migrations":false}}`/503 — same running process, no restart.
Readiness self-heals once Postgres comes back, still without restarting
Usher. Corrupting `alembic_version` on an otherwise-healthy database
produces the same degraded/503 shape with `database: true, migrations:
false` — a live demonstration is in the "readiness reports migration
state" commit.

Every request gets a real server span (`FastAPIInstrumentor`, wired in
`create_app`) with SQLAlchemy queries and outbound httpx calls nested under
it (`SQLAlchemyInstrumentor`/`HTTPXClientInstrumentor`, wired in
`configure_tracing`) — without this, nothing ever called
`tracer.start_as_current_span()` during request handling, so
`inject_trace_context` never fired in the running service, only in tests
that built their own span. `configure_tracing`/`configure_metrics` install a
real `TracerProvider`/`MeterProvider` *unconditionally* (a bare provider
with zero processors still assigns valid ids/records instruments, verified
directly) — only the actual OTLP *export* is conditional on
`settings.telemetry_enabled`. Both are `isinstance`-guarded against being
reconfigured on a second `create_app()` call in the same process (verified
directly: without the guard, 5 calls with telemetry enabled leaked 5
background export threads; with it, flat at the 2 the first call installs).
With no `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` set, the default (unset) config still
carries zero *export*-related risk — nothing gRPC-related is ever
constructed. If an endpoint *is* set but nothing is listening there, the
OTel SDK's own retry loop logs a warning rather than raising or hanging the
app — graceful, but not literally silent in that specific case.

Stdlib `logging` (uvicorn's access/error logs, SQLAlchemy warnings, the OTel
exporter's own retry messages) is bridged into loguru via `_InterceptHandler`
(loguru's own documented recipe) — without it, confirmed on a live run, only
`usher`'s own logger calls were structured JSON; everything else printed as
plain text, ignored `log_level`/`log_json`, and never got
`trace_id`/`span_id` patched in.

`get_session` (`api/deps.py`) is the request's commit/rollback boundary:
commits once the handler completes without raising, rolls back and
re-raises otherwise. Previously nothing in `src/` ever called `commit()` —
`ports/repository.py`'s "the caller owns the session and the transaction"
had no concrete caller yet, so a future write endpoint that forgot to
commit would have lost data silently.

`/health` and `/health/ready` responses are typed (`api/dto/health.py`,
`LivenessResponse`/`ReadinessResponse`/`ReadinessChecks`), so
`/openapi.json` describes real shapes instead of `{"type": "object"}`.

`tests/integration/test_health.py`'s async `client` fixture needs
`asgi_lifespan.LifespanManager` (new dev dependency) wrapping the app:
`httpx.ASGITransport` only implements the ASGI "http" protocol, not
"lifespan" (confirmed against its source and FastAPI's own docs), so a bare
`AsyncClient(transport=ASGITransport(app=app))` never runs `create_app`'s
lifespan and `app.state.session_factory` is never set. Reproduced directly:
without the fix, `/health/ready` raises `AttributeError` while the other two
tests in the file still pass. `deps.py`'s `get_session_factory` now raises a
diagnosable `RuntimeError` for this exact case instead of Starlette's
generic `AttributeError`.

Not yet available — depend on code later M1 groups haven't written:
`docker compose up` (needs Group G's `Dockerfile`/`compose.yml`). Group G
should also know: Task 13's plan text still shows the pre-review expected
`/health/ready` body (missing `migrations`) and `compose.yml` has no
`healthcheck` on the `usher` service itself — see the amendment after
Task 12 in `docs/plans/2026-07-28-m1-foundation.md`.
