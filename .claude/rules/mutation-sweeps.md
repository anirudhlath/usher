# Mutation sweeps: harness mechanics and per-task ledgers

Verified facts, loaded when planning or running a mutation sweep. Measured or
observed, never assumed — each entry carries its date, its sample and what it
refuted. The always-on conventions live in `CLAUDE.md`; the test-design findings
these sweeps produced live in `.claude/rules/testing-discipline.md`.

**M5's final mutation sweep: 56 mutations, 50 killed, and every one of the
six survivors was predicted.** Run 2026-08-02 in place, each mutation
against the **whole** 2,098-test suite rather than its own task's selection.
Baseline green before (`2098 passed, 2 skipped in 47.20s`), restored green
after, the group-G harness's rules enforced throughout — target must appear
exactly once, `cp` backups never `git checkout --`, a run that did not run is
`DID-NOT-RUN`, a syntax error is `BROKEN-MUTATION`, a hang is `HUNG`.
**Zero HUNG, zero DID-NOT-RUN, zero BROKEN**, and every mutation was
dry-run through `ast.parse` before the sweep started so an `IndentationError`
could not be scored as a kill.

The six survivors, and the one prediction that was wrong in the *other*
direction:

- **Five are the plan's own named equivalent mutants, each surviving for
  the stated reason**: the `stale_after` boundary (`<=` → `<`; the clocks in
  those cases step past the boundary rather than onto it), the
  `except asyncio.CancelledError: raise` arm (a `BaseException` in 3.13, so
  the `UsherPortError` arm would not catch it anyway), `list(self._subscribers)`
  (`publish` does not await, so nothing can be removed mid-iteration),
  `rpartition` → `partition` (the epoch is hex and holds no `-`), and
  `is ENRICHED` in place of the rank comparison (both agree on all three
  rungs today).
- **The sixth is `_write_push_available`'s "nothing changed" guard**, which
  is not on the plan's list but *is* already recorded above as an equivalent
  mutant against today's repository: SQLAlchemy emits no `UPDATE` when no
  attribute actually changed, so the `set_updated_at` trigger never fires
  either way.
- **The plan's sixth named survivor was killed, and for a different reason
  than the plan reasoned about.** `socket_logger`'s `propagate = False` was
  predicted to survive because "the level alone is sufficient", which is
  true *as a security property* — and it dies anyway, on
  `test_the_socket_logger_is_re_silenced_on_every_call`, which pins all
  three fields directly rather than asserting the leak. Worth knowing before
  anyone reads that kill as evidence the propagate flag is load-bearing for
  the token.

Three results worth carrying forward. The milestone's headline mutation —
moving `failures = 0` from delivery to connection — **fails 4 cases**, so
PRD 08's "after N failures mark `supports_push = false`" cannot silently
stop firing against a buffering proxy. Deleting the watchdog call fails 4,
and `is_delivering` returning `self.connected` fails **11**, the largest
blast radius in the sweep. And the ADR-0014 mutation on the *third* payload
shape (`play_count=as_int(entry.get("PlayCount"))` in `user_data_states`)
fails 2 — which matters more now that the live run has shown that field
would be *telling the truth*: the test suite forbids reading it on the
strength of a rule about evidence, not on the strength of the value being
wrong.
**M4's final mutation sweep: 39 mutations, one survivor, and the survivor is
an equivalent mutant the code comment predicted.** Run 2026-07-31 in place,
each mutation against the **whole** 1,713-test suite rather than its own
task's selection — which is the point of a final sweep, since a per-task
sweep cannot see collateral in another file. Baseline green before,
restored green after, `/tmp/mutate.py`'s rules enforced throughout (a run
that did not run is `DID-NOT-RUN`, never `KILLED`; the target must appear
exactly once; `cp` backups, never `git checkout --`). **38/39 killed.**

The survivor is `priority = GREATEST(jobs.priority, excluded.priority)` →
`priority = excluded.priority` in `_ENQUEUE`, and it survives because the
same statement's `WHERE jobs.status <> 'parked' AND jobs.priority <
excluded.priority` already guarantees `excluded.priority` is the larger.
`jobs.py`'s own comment says exactly this and keeps both anyway ("one is
*when* to write, the other *what* to write"). Verified rather than assumed:
removing **both** together fails 2 cases, so PRD 03's no-demotion property is
covered — by the `WHERE` clause. So
`test_re_enqueueing_at_a_lower_priority_does_not_demote` passes against a
`SET` clause that would demote, and is really a test of the predicate. Worth
knowing before anyone "simplifies" the `WHERE` on the strength of that case's
name.

Two other results worth carrying forward. `claim-without-skip-locked` is the
only mutation whose run is measurably slower (57.2 s against a ~41.6 s
baseline) — that is `asyncio.wait_for` bounding the blocked claim rather than
the suite hanging, which is why `pytest-timeout` is deliberately not a
dependency. And `usable-ids-filters-nothing` **is** caught (2 cases), by
`test_a_malformed_imdb_id_does_not_abort_the_batch`'s *second* item, whose
only id is unusable — the first item survives the mutation intact, so a
version of that case carrying one item would have ratified it.
**Mutation sweeps on this host: the shell is zsh, and it does not
word-split an unquoted `$VAR`.** A selection passed as `$C="path1 path2"`
reaches pytest as one bogus path, nothing runs, the exit code is non-zero,
and a naive harness records the mutation as caught having measured nothing.
Three were, before the harness started requiring that a run actually ran.
Same family as the venv-shebang trap: the sweep proves nothing and looks
like it proved something.
**M6's sweep: 61 mutations, 50 killed, 11 survived, 0 HUNG, 0 DID-NOT-RUN —
and three harness findings, one of which defeats the plan's own trap rule.**

- **`ast.parse` is NOT sufficient to dry-run a mutation, and `compile()` is.**
  `ast.parse` **accepts** `continue` outside a loop — that error is raised by
  the *compile* stage — so a mutation spelled with a stray `continue` passed
  the dry run, the suite died at collection in 1 s, and the harness scored it
  `KILLED` against an unrelated file. Caught by reading the log, not by the
  rule. Validate with `compile(source, path, "exec")`, and additionally score
  `ERROR collecting` + `SyntaxError` as `BROKEN-MUTATION`. This is trap rule 3
  ("a run that collected zero tests is DID-NOT-RUN") failing in a way the rule
  as written does not cover: the run *did* collect, it collected an error.
- **SIGTERM skips the `finally`, so a killed sweep leaves the tree mutated.**
  `pkill` on the harness mid-mutation left `ports/search.py` modified. The `cp`
  backup is what recovered it — `git checkout --` would have been M5 group F's
  disaster again. A sweep harness needs a signal handler, or the operator needs
  to check `git status` after every interruption.
- **A mutation must be the change the plan names, not a change that happens to
  break the statement.** "`updated_at = now()` dropped from the `DO UPDATE`
  clause" spelled as a *replacement* with an assignment already in that clause
  is a duplicate `SET`, i.e. a SQL error, and scored a false kill against a
  mutation the plan correctly calls equivalent. Deleted properly, it survives.
**And one real coverage gap the sweep found, now closed.**
`test_the_port_does_not_ask_callers_to_apply_a_query_prefix` read
`inspect.getdoc(Embedder)` only. The deleted clause happened to live on the
*class* docstring, so the guard was written against where it was rather than
where it could go: restoring "callers are responsible for any query-side
instruction prefix" on **`Embedder.embed`** — the more natural place, since
`embed` is the method the instruction is about — survived all 2,433 cases. The
guard now scans every docstring on the port. Same shape as the `sitecustomize`
installation proof in `fixtures-and-fakes.md`: a guard scoped to one surface of
two reads as coverage.
**Two plan predictions about survivors were wrong, in opposite directions.**
Task 12's `stored.model_name == …` was predicted to survive "because
`FakeEmbedder` has one model name", with an instruction not to strengthen the
fake — it is **killed** by
`test_a_model_swap_re_embeds_a_title_whose_text_did_not_change`, which seeds
two model names without touching the fake. And the milestone's **headline**
refusal mutation is killed by exactly **one** case in 2,433, and it is not the
one the plan named: `test_a_refused_title_leaves_the_backfill_after_one_pass`
writes the refused row *directly* (its own docstring says the case is about the
predicate), so it cannot see a service-side skip at all; the cover is the unit
case `test_a_degenerate_title_is_written_with_a_null_embedding_rather_than_skipped`.
**A mutation sweep can execute the *previous* mutant's bytecode against the
current mutant's source, and the log reads as a clean kill.** Found 2026-08-05
on M8 Task 7's two curation domain models. One run of
`tests/unit/test_domain_curation.py` is **0.284 s**, and CPython validates a
cached `.pyc` on `(int(source_mtime), source_size)` — **mtime at one-second
resolution**. Deleting either of `LLMCall.model_post_init`'s two clauses
(the hook was renamed to `_ok_and_error_must_agree` and moved to a
`model_validator(mode="after")` shortly afterwards, so grep for that; the old
name is kept here because it is what the sweep actually ran against)
removes **exactly 114 bytes**, so the two mutants are byte-identical in length;
a whole mutate → run → restore → mutate cycle fits inside one second, so the
second mutant collides with the first on *both* halves of that validation pair
and the interpreter reuses the first one's bytecode. Restoring the original in
between does not save you — it has a different size, so it recompiles, and only
the two mutants match each other. Both scored `KILLED` naming the same failing
case. Hand-reproduced in isolation, deleting clause 2 kills two *different*
cases (`..._must_say_what_went_wrong_and_an_empty_string_does_not` and
`evolve_re_runs_the_ok_error_agreement`), so the sweep had scored one mutation
against another's result and would have ratified a clause nothing tested.

**It is a new spelling of "a run that did not run is not a pass", and the rule
as written does not cover it: the run *did* run.** It collected 25 tests,
executed them, and failed — on the wrong code. Every prior member of that
family produced *no* result (a suite that collected zero tests, a contract
suite skipped because nothing was configured, a guard that globbed nothing);
this one produces a complete, plausible, wrong one. Nearest relative is the
`ast.parse`-versus-`compile()` finding above, where the run also got as far as
collecting — it collected an error.

Three defences, and the third is what makes the other two checkable: delete
every `__pycache__` under `src/` before each run, set
`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` in the subprocess environment so none is written
back, and carry an **equivalent-mutant control** — one mutation that must
SURVIVE (reordering `__all__`'s members will do). A sweep reporting every
mutation killed cannot distinguish a suite with teeth from a harness that
scores every run as a kill, and the control is the only thing that tells them
apart. Under all three, the same 37 mutations gave 36 killed and exactly the
one intended survivor. **The faster the selection, the worse this gets** — a
per-task sweep over one file is precisely where runs are short enough to
collide, and a whole-suite sweep at 40 s a run never would have shown it.

⚠️ **The `__all__` control is a control on the *suite*, not a change nothing
catches, and reporting it as the latter is wrong.** Measured 2026-08-07 on M8
Task 15's review: reordering `usher/services/rows/curated.py`'s `__all__` is
caught by `uv run ruff check` — `RUF022 __all__ is not sorted`, which is in
`[tool.ruff.lint] select`. It still does exactly the job the paragraph above
asks of it (a mutation pytest must not kill, proving the harness is not scoring
every run as a kill), because a sweep runs pytest and not the gate. Two
corollaries for the sentence a sweep result gets written up in: say *"survived
the suite"*, never *"nothing catches it"*, and pick controls that survive
`ruff`/`mypy`/`lint-imports` too if the claim is going to be about the gate.
Same family as **"a survivor list is only true of the selection it was measured
against"**, which is recorded in `testing-discipline.md`. Related, from the
same review: a control that is
*behaviourally* equivalent is not therefore unkillable — restating a score
constant's literal, or returning a `slug_prefix` as a literal instead of the
imported name, both survive the suite behaviourally and this repository kills
exactly that class **structurally** elsewhere
(`test_the_curated_module_holds_no_llm_client_and_cannot_complete_anything`
asserts over `ast.unparse` of the module). Write "cannot be killed
behaviourally", which is a claim about the assertions; "genuinely cannot be
killed" is a claim about the repository and is false here.

**The corollary was written down and then not applied to the very next task,
so here are two controls that pass the whole gate.** M8 Task 16 shipped the
same defect one commit later — both its reported "equivalent-mutant controls"
were `__all__` reorders, i.e. mutations `ruff` rejects, which demonstrate
nothing about whether the *suite* would catch a defect that could ship.
Re-measured 2026-08-07 against the whole 2,7xx-case `tests/unit` **and** all
four gate steps:

| control | `pytest tests/unit` | `ruff check` | `ruff format --check` | `mypy src tests` | `lint-imports` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| two independent `worker.register` calls in `composition.build_worker` swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| one sentence of `curate_handler`'s docstring reworded | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `services/handlers.py`'s `__all__` reordered | PASS | **rc=1 `RUF022`** | PASS | PASS | PASS |

The register swap is the better of the two, because its equivalence is a
*fact about the code* rather than about what the tools look at:
`JobWorker.register` writes a dict, `registered_kinds` returns a `frozenset`,
`run_once` passes `list(self._handlers)` to a `claim` that spells it
`kind = ANY(:kinds)` in Postgres and `set(kinds)` in the fake — so no layer
below the registration can observe the order. A docstring reword is the
cheaper one and is safe **only after checking that no case scans that
module's prose**: `grep -rn "getdoc\|__doc__\|ast.unparse\|getsource" tests/`
finds guards over `ports/embedding.py`, `ports/metadata.py`,
`services/home.py`, `services/curation.py`, `services/reconcile.py` and
`services/rows/`, and a control planted in one of those is a kill waiting to
be misread as a suite with teeth.
**Run the control against the gate, not only against pytest, and put the
verdict per step in the write-up** — one line per tool is what makes the
difference between the two claims visible.

**The `-q`/`-qq` trap bit a sweep harness, and it presents as DID-NOT-RUN.**
`addopts` already carries `-q`, so a harness adding its own makes it `-qq`,
which suppresses the `N passed, M failed` summary line entirely — on a *green*
run there is no line at all. The verdict regex then matches nothing and eight
mutations were scored `DID-NOT-RUN` while their own `FAILED …` lines were
printed in the same output. Caught only because the harness prints the failing
case names beside the verdict; a harness that printed the verdict alone would
have reported eight mutations as unobserved. Harnesses in this repository must
not pass `-q`.

**`git checkout <path>` reverts uncommitted work, not just the plant — and the
existing rule against it did not cover the case that bit.** The entry above
forbids it *in a sweep harness*, where the `cp` backup is what recovers a
SIGTERM. Found 2026-08-06 in M8 Task 10 review: the same command run by hand,
to undo a **one-line plant made outside the harness** during a before/after
demonstration, silently discarded twenty lines of uncommitted documentation
edits in the same file. The plant itself reverted correctly, the gate stayed
green, `git status` simply stopped listing the file, and the loss was found
only because the next grep looked for a symbol that should have been there.

**Sweep totals for the same task, for calibration, and this is the breakdown to
quote:** 36 mutations over one pure module — **34 killed, 1 control surviving
as designed, 1 unintended survivor** which was the real coverage gap above, now
closed and killed on re-run. Commit `e902b38`'s message partitions the same run
as *"35 as expected"* by grouping the intended control with the kills; both
totals are 36 and neither is wrong, but the three-way split is the one that
says something, because it separates *"the suite caught it"* from *"the suite
was designed not to catch it"* from *"the suite missed it"*.

The three defences against the `.pyc` collision recorded further up were in
force throughout — `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, `__pycache__` swept before
every run, and an equivalent-mutant control — which mattered here for exactly
the reason that entry predicts: the module's own test file runs in **0.10 s**,
well inside the one-second mtime resolution.

**Sweeping in a `cp -a` copy of the repo silently sweeps the *original*, and
the log reads as a clean set of survivors.** Found 2026-08-06 while reviewing
M8 Task 13, by a reviewer whose own first sweep was invalid. "Copy the tree to
`/tmp` and mutate there, so the real checkout is never touched" is an
attractive move and now a common one — it removes the in-place sweep's rule
that nothing else may use the tree. It does not work by default: `cp -a`
copies `.venv/` **including `.venv/bin/pytest`, whose shebang is an absolute
path to the source venv's interpreter**, and `uv run pytest` in the copy
therefore starts the original interpreter, resolves `usher` through the
original `site-packages` `.pth`, and imports the **unmutated** module. Every
mutation survives, which reads as a suite with no teeth rather than as a
harness that measured nothing.

**This is the documented venv-shebang trap in a new location**, and it belongs
with the sweep rules rather than only with the deployment ones, because the
symptom inverts: the same trap in a deployment context produces an obvious
failure, and here it produces a plausible, complete, wrong result. Same family
as the `.pyc` collision above and as `sitecustomize.py` not being on
`PYTHONPATH` (`fixtures-and-fakes.md`) — all three are a run that ran, against
the wrong code.

Two defences, and the second is the one that generalises: rebuild the copy's
environment (`uv sync` in the copy) rather than trusting `cp -a`, and **assert
the module's `__file__` resolves under the copy before every run**. The
`__file__` check is cheap, it is independent of how the environment was built,
and unlike the shebang it keeps working when the next person reaches for
`rsync`, a container mount, or a worktree. An in-place sweep gets the same
assurance for free, which is a real argument for staying in place.

**Round totals, 2026-08-07:** 60 plants over `services/curation.py`,
`services/curation_prompt.py` and two fakes — **56 killed, 4 equivalent-mutant
controls surviving as designed, 0 unintended survivors**, after two survivors
found mid-round (the `\r\n` one above and the `time.time` one) were respectively
closed and reclassified with evidence. The three `.pyc`-collision defences were
in force throughout: both curation test files run in **0.26 s** together, well
inside the one-second mtime resolution that entry is about.

**A sweep mutates the whole working tree, so a second agent working anywhere in
the repo can invalidate it — disjoint file sets are not enough.** Found
2026-08-06, dispatching M8 Tasks 7 and 8 concurrently. Their file sets did not
overlap, which is the test that usually settles this, and it is the wrong test:
Task 7 was running in-place mutation sweeps while Task 8 ran the suite. A sweep
is only sound if the *only* difference between the green run and the red run is
the plant, and a concurrent agent's uncommitted edit anywhere the suite imports
breaks that premise in both directions — a survivor that was really killed by
somebody else's half-finished edit, or a kill credited to a plant that a
neighbouring change actually caused. Neither is visible in the output; both read
as a clean result. No damage that time (the sweeps were ~4 s and the restores
md5-verified), which is the point: the failure is silent and the near miss is
the only warning you get.

**M8 Task 19's sweep: 41 mutations over the genome tag vocabulary — 36 killed,
3 equivalent-mutant controls surviving as designed, 2 measured survivors
reported rather than replaced.** 49 plant-runs to get there: **three mutations
were mis-spelled**, one was scored `BROKEN-MUTATION` by the harness, and one
was scored `KILLED` *wrongly* and corrected (see below). **The three-way split
is the one that says something** — 38 behavioural mutations of which 36 died,
against 3 the suite was designed not to catch. Run in place under the three
`.pyc` defences and the harness rules recorded above. Baseline established
green on a clean tree first:
**2,817 unit / 4 skipped**, **898 integration / 8 skipped**, ruff, `ruff format
--check`, mypy over 435 files, 8 import contracts. (The **three** cases the
round added to close its own findings — two unit, one integration — take the
final numbers to **2,819 / 899**. It said "two" until 2026-08-07: the count
was taken from the unit column alone, which is the arithmetic error to expect
whenever a round reports one number for a suite that has two.)

**The three controls, each against every gate step** — which is the check the
`__all__` entry above exists to force, and all three pass all five:

| control | `pytest tests/unit` | `ruff check` | `ruff format --check` | `mypy src tests` | `lint-imports` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `__table_args__`'s two independent `CheckConstraint`s swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `_vocabulary_line`'s empty-genome and mixed-release branches swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| one sentence of `_refuse_partial_vocabulary`'s docstring reworded | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

The first two are facts about the *code* rather than about what the tools look
at: `__table_args__` order has no semantics (Alembic's `compare_metadata`
matches by name, and the case that reads them asserts a **set**), and
`len(()) > 1` is false so the mixed-release arm can never answer the empty
case. The docstring reword is the cheap one and was checked first against the
docstring-scan grep recorded above, which does not cover `db/repositories/`.

**Three mutations were mis-spelled. The first two manufactured a *survivor*,
which is the direction this file already documents; the third manufactured a
*kill*, which it does not, and that one is written up at the end.**

- *"The precondition runs after the DELETE"* was first spelled as **adding** a
  second `_refuse_partial_vocabulary` call inside the SAVEPOINT while the
  original stayed — a duplicate, not a move, and equivalent by construction.
  Respelled as a move it fails 3 cases. "A mutation must be the change the plan
  names", verbatim.
- *"The vocabulary is stamped with a freshly resolved revision"* survived
  because every transport in `tests/unit/test_cli.py` answers **one** ETag, so
  the mutant's wrong answer equals the right one — the `\r\n` finding's shape in
  the revision domain. Closed by a case whose transport hands back a different
  token each call and whose premise resolves once more to prove it, and the
  mutation then fails on it.

**The survivor that is real, measured and kept:** gating the vocabulary write
on `run.rows_written` instead of on `run.status is COMPLETED` **survives all
2,819 unit cases**, and it is *not* the plausible defect. `ImportRun.
rows_written` is cumulative across resumes, so the M7-upgrade path this gate
exists for — a completed checkpoint that yields no batch — still reads truthy
and still writes the vocabulary. The two answers differ only for a completed
run that has *never* written a vector, which is a catalog holding no genome
movie at all, where a vocabulary explains nothing. The defect an implementer
would actually write is a **per-run** tally, and that one fails
`test_a_completed_checkpoint_that_writes_no_vector_still_loads_the_vocabulary`.
**The general form: before writing a survivor up as a coverage gap, check
whether the mutant and the original differ on any state the system can be in —
a counter that accumulates across runs is not the counter the gate was reaching
for.**

**And the same task shipped the *opposite* claim in two files, which is the
half worth carrying.** `cli._movielens`' docstring and that case's own
docstring both argued that a gate on rows-written *"would leave exactly that
deployment without one, forever, with nothing to say so"* — the sweep had
already measured that it would not, and the second copy of it was a test
docstring claiming a kill the test does not make. Re-measured at `d4189b7` on
2026-08-07, after Task 20: `if run.rows_written:` passes **2,883 unit and 899
integration**, i.e. the whole suite, while a per-run tally fails that one case
alone (measured twice — at 2,882 before this round's own case landed and again
at 2,883 after, because a number quoted in a docstring is compared against the
suite a later reader runs, not against the one it was taken from). Both passages now carry the sweep's argument instead. **A survivor a
sweep reports is a claim about the code, so it has to be reconciled with every
docstring arguing the opposite — a sweep finding that contradicts a shipped
comment means one of the two is being shipped wrong, and the comment is the
one nobody re-runs.**

**And the second survivor is the one whose first measurement was wrong, which
is the more useful half.** `except DBAPIError` in `replace_genome_tags`
narrowed to `except IntegrityError` was first scored **KILLED**, naming two
integration cases — and the spelling had not imported `IntegrityError`, so the
`except` clause raised `NameError` at the moment it was evaluated. `compile()`
does not see an undefined name, the suite ran, two cases failed, and the log
read as a clean kill *of the mutation the plan named* rather than of a typo.
Respelled with the import (and re-planted by hand, since the change is two
anchors in one file), it **survives all 57 relevant integration cases and all
2,819 unit cases** — which was the prediction, and which is the opposite of the
`curated_rows."position"` finding one file over.

That survival is the intended consequence of `m08b`'s column choice rather than
a gap: with `tag_id` as `integer` behind a batch precondition, every
*reachable* refusal on this table is a CHECK violation, i.e. an
`IntegrityError`, so the wider `except` is defence in depth against the next
column rather than the load-bearing clause. Reported with its measurement, not
tidied to match.

**The rule this adds, because the existing ones do not cover it.** This file
already says a broken mutation must not be scored as a kill, and the harness
already scores `ERROR collecting` and `SyntaxError` as `BROKEN-MUTATION` — but
a `NameError` inside an `except` clause is none of those: it is raised at
*handling* time, on the failure path, in exactly the cases the mutation is
aimed at, so it produces a plausible kill naming plausible tests. **A mutation
that changes an `except`, an `isinstance`, or any other name-resolving
expression on a path only the failing cases reach has to be checked for the
names it introduces** — the cheap check is that the mutated file's new
identifiers are already imported, and the cheap tell is a kill whose failing
cases are *exactly* the ones written for that clause.

**M8 Task 20's sweep: 55 mutations over query expansion — 51 killed, 3
equivalent-mutant controls surviving as designed, 1 measured survivor since
closed.** Run 2026-08-07 in place against the **whole `tests/unit` selection**
(2,881 cases, ~20 s a run), over `services/query_expansion.py`,
`services/search.py`, `composition.py` and `cli.py`. **0 BAD-ANCHOR, 0
BROKEN-MUTATION, 0 DID-NOT-RUN.** The three `.pyc` defences and the harness
rules recorded above were in force throughout. Baseline established green on a
clean tree first: **2,819 unit / 4 skipped**, **899 integration / 8 skipped**.
The three controls, each against every gate step — all three pass all five:

| control | `pytest tests/unit` | `ruff check` | `ruff format --check` | `mypy src tests` | `lint-imports` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `_ledger_row`'s `tokens_in`/`tokens_out` keyword arguments swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `SearchService.__init__`'s `self._titles`/`self._media_items` writes swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| one sentence of `_settle`'s docstring reworded | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

The first two are facts about the *code* rather than about what the tools look
at: keyword arguments are evaluated in written order and both expressions are
side-effect-free, and two attribute writes from two distinct parameters cannot
observe each other. The docstring reword was checked first against the
docstring-scan grep recorded above — **none of the files it finds scans
`services/query_expansion.py`, `services/search.py`, `composition.py` or
`cli.py`.**

**The one real survivor and why it was closed rather than reported.** `_ms`'
`max(0, …)` clamp deleted survived all 2,881 cases. It is *not* an equivalent
mutant: `latency_ms` is `ge=0` on `LLMCall` and `>= 0` in the column, so a
negative delta is a `ValidationError` raised from inside `_ledger_row`, on the
path that has just spent money, and out through an `expand` whose caller was
promised it never raises. `time.monotonic` is non-decreasing by contract, so
the clamp is unreachable with the shipped clock — **the injected one is the
only thing that can break the promise, which is exactly what makes a guard
against a promise nobody breaks testable at all** (same shape as `_cosine`'s
zero-norm guard, in `testing-discipline.md`). Re-planted after the case landed,
it fails **that case
alone**. The general form: *when a guard survives, ask which collaborator
could falsify the promise it defends; if one is already injected, the case
costs three lines and the survivor is a gap rather than an equivalence.*

**And two shapes worth carrying, both about where a sweep has to look.**

- **A prompt sweep's yield is near 100% and this one confirms it a second
  time.** Eight of the 55 mutations are prompt or sanitiser mutations
  (`build_expansion_prompt`), and all eight died — because every one of them
  had a case *written for it by name*. The artefact was enumerated before the
  control flow was, which is the method M8 Task 12's blind spot produced. The
  boundary is stated in the test file rather than left implicit: the key, the
  character bound, the JSON instruction, the query's own rendering, the order
  of the two blocks and "every declared rule reaches the prompt" are pinned;
  **the wording of the rules and of the role sentence is not**, and a rule
  deleted from `EXPANSION_RULES` itself is deliberately outside the case that
  iterates it.

**M8 Task 21's sweep: 18 mutations over the query-expansion switch — 14 killed
on the first pass, 3 equivalent-mutant controls surviving as designed, 1
unintended survivor since closed (so 15 of 15 behavioural mutations killed on
re-run).** The three-way split is the one that says something; "15 killed"
alone would hide the gap the round was for. Run 2026-08-07 in place against the
**whole
`tests/unit` selection** (2,892 cases, ~20 s a run), over `config.py`,
`composition.py`, `cli.py` and `services/query_expansion.py`. **0 BAD-ANCHOR,
0 BROKEN-MUTATION, 0 DID-NOT-RUN.** The three `.pyc` defences and the harness
rules recorded above were in force throughout. Baseline established green on a
clean tree first: **2,883 unit / 4 skipped**, **899 integration / 8 skipped**,
ruff, `ruff format --check`, mypy over 437 files, 8 import contracts. **Every
kill was checked against the case written for it** — each of the 15 names the
case its mutation was aimed at, with the only collateral being the inverted
validator (5 cases, because a settings model that refuses the *reachable*
pairing takes every fixture configured that way with it).

The three controls, each against every gate step — all three pass all five:

| control | `pytest tests/unit` | `ruff check` | `ruff format --check` | `mypy src tests` | `lint-imports` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cli._search`'s two conjuncts swapped (`settings.query_expansion_enabled and model is not None`) | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `build_pipeline`'s two disjuncts swapped (`not settings.query_expansion_enabled or llm is None`) | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| one sentence of `_query_expansion_needs_a_client`'s docstring reworded | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

The first two are facts about the *code* rather than about what the tools look
at: both operands of each are side-effect-free pure reads (an `is None` test
and an attribute read on a settings model), so short-circuit order cannot be
observed. The docstring reword was checked first against the docstring-scan
grep recorded above — **none of the files it finds scans `config.py`,
`composition.py`, `cli.py` or `services/query_expansion.py`.**

**The unintended survivor is a new shape: a two-armed guard whose second arm is
held by `mypy` and by nothing in the suite.** `build_pipeline`'s
`if llm is None or not settings.query_expansion_enabled` — dropping the *first*
disjunct survived all 2,892 unit cases, because the only case reaching that arm
had the setting off, so the mutant answered `None` for the other reason. It is
**not** an equivalent mutant and it is **not** a hole in the gate:
`QueryExpansionService.client` is `LLMClient`, `llm` is `LLMClient | None`, and
the `is None` test is the only thing that narrows it, so `mypy` reports
`arg-type` on the mutant (measured — ruff, `ruff format --check` and
`lint-imports` all pass, mypy is the one that fails). The reachable damage is
real: `unit_of_work`, which is how `usher.api.lanes` and `usher work` build
every pipeline, passes **no `llm`**, so on a deployment with both switches on
the mutant constructs a `QueryExpansionService(client=None)` whose first
`complete_json` is an `AttributeError` inside a search. Closed by
`test_a_switch_on_with_no_client_to_hand_still_builds_no_expander`, which seeds
exactly that configuration; re-planted, the mutation fails **that case alone**.
**The rule this adds: when a survivor is caught by a *type* checker rather than
by a test, say which tool and measure it — "the gate holds it" and "the suite
holds it" are different claims, and a boolean guard with two arms needs a
fixture per arm exactly as a `WHERE` clause with two predicates does** (the
"two predicates, one selectivity" entry in `testing-discipline.md`, arriving at
a disjunction in Python instead of a conjunction in SQL).

**M8 Task 18's review round: 12 plants — 9 killed, 3 equivalent-mutant
controls surviving as designed, 0 unintended survivors, 0 BAD-ANCHOR, 0
BROKEN-MUTATION, 0 DID-NOT-RUN.** Run 2026-08-07 in place over
`src/usher/cli.py` and `src/usher/telemetry.py`, with the three `.pyc`
defences in force and every kill checked against the case it was aimed at —
each of the nine names that case and nothing else, except the always-plural
plant, which correctly takes three (two unit, one integration). The three
controls, each against every gate step:

| control | `pytest tests/unit` | `ruff check` | `ruff format --check` | `mypy src tests` | `lint-imports` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `OPERATOR_ERRORS`' `PortAuthFailed` and `PortRateLimited` entries swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `_print_curation_report`'s `kept =` / `cards =` bindings swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| one sentence of `cli._unit`'s docstring reworded | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

The first two are facts about the *code*: an `except` tuple is matched by
`isinstance` over classes that are pairwise disjoint, so its order is
unobservable, and two pure reads of the same tuple cannot observe each other.
The docstring reword was checked against the docstring-scan grep recorded
above; none of the eight files it finds scans `cli.py` or `telemetry.py`.

Three findings worth carrying:

- **A `sink == []` assertion is a false green wherever the fixture makes the
  logging impossible.** `usher curate`'s success path prints a report and, on
  the shipped defaults, printed a ~900-character `httpx` INFO envelope on
  stdout in front of it — `report=False` silences *Usher's* line and can do
  nothing about a third-party library's. The obvious case for it cannot see
  it: the integration fixture substitutes `FakeLLMClient`, which opens no
  socket, so `sink == []` over that fixture passes against a shipped path
  that logs. The case with teeth is one layer down, in
  `tests/unit/test_telemetry.py`, driving the **stdlib** logger directly
  through `configure_logging` — and it asserts through a **DEBUG** loguru
  sink, so a "fix" that raised the sink threshold instead would fail it.
  Second arm too (`WARNING` still arrives), which the `CRITICAL` plant kills
  on its own. **General form: before writing a negative assertion about
  output, ask what in the fixture makes the output impossible, and put the
  case where that thing is real.** Same family as "a run that did not run is
  not a pass", in the fixture rather than the harness.
- **`Class.__subclasses__()` is the only honest way to enumerate a taxonomy,
  and it needs the imports to have happened.** `UsherPortError` has **nine**
  subclasses; `.claude/rules/config-cli-and-deployment.md` said "the base and
  four leaves" until it was corrected to nine, and a review said six. Both
  counted `ports/errors.py` and
  missed `SourceNotSupported`, `FilterNotSupported` and
  `AvailabilitySweepRefused`, which live beside the ports whose contract they
  belong to. The exhaustiveness assertion imports all three explicitly, since
  a class nothing has imported is a subclass Python does not report — an
  assertion over `__subclasses__()` alone would have silently agreed with the
  undercount. **Never hand-write the members of a taxonomy a case is about to
  make a claim over.**
- **A message assertion and a database assertion in the same case can be made
  to contradict each other, and that is what gives a wording fix teeth.**
  `usher curate`'s failure sentence claimed "nothing was written" on a path
  the same case pins as billed (`len(ledger) == 1`). `"previous rows still
  stand" in message` is satisfied by both wordings; `"nothing was written"
  not in message`, sitting six lines above `len(ledger) == 1`, is not — and
  the pair reads as one argument rather than two assertions.

**A defect has a careless spelling and a careful one, a linter usually catches
only the careless one, and reporting "the tools hold it" on that basis is
backwards.** Two instances make this a shape rather than two anecdotes, and it
is worth naming because the careless spelling is the one an author writes by
accident and the careful one is the one that ships:

| the defect | careless spelling | caught by | careful spelling | caught by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| a router reaching the LLM through the composition root (M8 Task 17) | the import placed outside its isort position | `ruff check` `I001` | the import in its isort position | nothing, until an eighth import contract |
| `OpenAICompatibleClient`'s latency read as an absolute rather than a delta (M8 final sweep) | `int(self._clock() * 1000)`, leaving `started` dangling | `ruff check` `F841` | `started` re-read *after* `await self._send(...)` | nothing, until the case below |

Both rows are `ruff check` and **neither is `ruff format`** — measured
2026-08-07 against `--isolated`, because the Task 17 entry above credited
`I001` to "the formatter" and that is wrong: `I` is in `[tool.ruff.lint]
select`, `ruff format` leaves import order alone (`rc=0`, *"1 file already
formatted"*, on the same probe `ruff check --select I` answers `rc=1` for).
A linter fires on the *shape* of the
edit — an unused name, an unsorted block — and the defect is in the
*semantics*, which is why the two come apart at all. Same family as, and the
generalisation of, the standing rule that a survivor caught by a type checker
has to name the tool and measure it: "the gate holds it" and "the suite holds
it" are different claims, and here they are different claims about the same
line depending on how it was typed.

**Round totals for the two findings recorded in `testing-discipline.md` — the
second appearance of the zero-origin fixture clock, and the write-guard —
because the three-way split is the one that says
something:** 5 plants over `adapters/llm/openai_compatible.py` and
`services/curation_pool.py` — **4 killed, 1 equivalent-mutant control surviving
as designed, 0 unintended survivors, 0 BAD-ANCHOR, 0 BROKEN-MUTATION, 0
DID-NOT-RUN.** Each kill names **exactly** the case written for it and nothing
else, and each fails on the number rather than on a `NameError` reached from an
`except` clause: `assert 0 == 1500` and `assert 1001500 == 1500` for the two
latency spellings, `assert 1 == 0` for both pool-guard spellings. Run
2026-08-07 in place against the whole `tests/unit` selection (2,903 cases,
~20 s a run) with the three `.pyc` defences and the harness rules recorded
above in force, the restore additionally verified by `md5sum`. Gate green
before and
after: **2,903 unit / 4 skipped**, **899 integration / 8 skipped**, mypy over
437 files, `lint-imports` 8 kept / 0 broken, PRD link check `OK`.

| control | `pytest tests/unit` | `ruff check` | `ruff format --check` | `mypy src tests` | `lint-imports` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `complete_json`'s two `span.set_attribute` calls swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

It is a fact about the *code* rather than about what the tools look at: an OTel
span's attributes are a map, both calls are side-effect-free reads of an
argument and an attribute, and neither can observe the other.

**M9 Task M1's sweep: 40 plants over `m09a` and its four models — 37 killed, 3
equivalent-mutant controls surviving as designed, 0 unintended survivors, 0
BAD-ANCHOR, 0 BROKEN-MUTATION, 0 DID-NOT-RUN.** Run 2026-08-10 in place, with
the plant list written down before the first run, the three `.pyc` defences in
force, and every restore verified by `md5sum` against the pre-plant digest.
Selection, stated because a survivor list is only true of the selection it was
measured against: `test_api_surface_schema.py`, `test_migrations.py`,
`test_bulk_repository.py`, `test_db_models.py`, `test_db_models_api_surface.py`
and `test_db_migration_status.py` (~15 s a run), plus
`test_title_match_repository.py` for the one plant outside the migration.

The plant list, by group: `downgrade()` losing each `drop_table` in turn and
the whole body replaced by `pass` (6); each of the eleven CHECKs deleted, plus
the owner CHECK loosened `= 1` → `>= 1` and the btree bound loosened by one
character (13); `text_pattern_ops` dropped from each prefix index on both the
migration and the model side, plus the opclass re-keyed on the expression text
(4); each of the six foreign keys' `ondelete` flipped (6); each cascade-lookup
index never created (2); the `_SUSPENDABLE_INDEXES` string losing one token
(1); four nullability/column-set mutations (4); the match path lowercasing the
probe instead of the column (1); three controls.

**Two results worth carrying.**

- **Every one of the six `downgrade()` plants is killed by exactly one case,
  and it is the same case for all six** —
  `test_a_full_down_and_up_cycle_restores_every_index`. Nothing else in the
  repository can see a `downgrade()` at all: the integration schema is built by
  one session-scoped `upgrade head` and never goes down. That is the argument
  for the "one assertion per table" rule stated as a measurement rather than as
  a rule — with four tables and one head, four of those six plants are
  distinguishable only by which assertion in that block fires.
- **A `pg_constraint` read filtered by a name pattern is a taxonomy that ages,
  and this landing aged one.** M4's
  `test_the_new_episode_foreign_keys_carry_the_delete_rule_they_were_given`
  reads `conname LIKE '%episode_id_episodes'`; `images` is the third table to
  reference `episodes`, so an M4 case failed on a correct M9 entry. Not a
  mutation — collateral found by running the suite — and the repair is to scope
  by `conrelid`. Same shape, in the same landing, as
  `test_name_year_matching_uses_the_expression_index` asserting an index *name*
  where a second expression index on `lower(name)` can now serve the same
  equality: both cases named an artefact where they meant a property. The plan
  assertion is now on the `Index Cond`, which is strictly stronger, and the
  swap was measured to cost nothing (200,000 rows: 4 buffers and 0.031 ms
  either way).

The three controls, each against every gate step — all three pass all five:

| control | `pytest tests/unit` | `ruff check` | `ruff format --check` | `mypy src tests` | `lint-imports` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `images`' `width` and `height` CHECKs swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| `images`' two independent cascade-lookup `create_index` calls swapped | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| one sentence of `ImageRow`'s docstring reworded | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

The first two are facts about the *code* rather than about what the tools look
at: a `CREATE TABLE`'s constraint list has no ordering semantics (Postgres
stores them by name and `test_every_check_constraint_in_the_models_exists_in_the_database`
compares a dict), and two `CREATE INDEX` statements on different columns of the
same table cannot observe each other. The docstring reword was checked first
against the docstring-scan grep this file records — the ten files it finds scan
`ports/`, `services/` and `api/`, and **none of them scans `db/models/`**.

And the repaired assertions were planted against, not just reasoned about: the
match-path case fails on its own `E` line under the defect it names (the plan
becomes `Hash Join` over a `Seq Scan`, `Hash Cond: ((t.name = lower(p.name)) …)`),
with the restore md5-verified.

**M9 Task A1's sweep: 5 plants over the new `usher.ports.repository` package —
2 targets killed, 3 equivalent-mutant controls of which only 2 pass all five
gate steps, 0 BAD-ANCHOR, 0 BROKEN-MUTATION, 0 DID-NOT-RUN.** Run 2026-08-11 in
place with the plant list and its **expected verdict** written down first, the
three `.pyc` defences in force, and every restore verified by `md5sum` against a
pre-plant digest of all 18 files. Baseline green on a clean tree first: **2,986
unit / 4 skipped**, **927 integration / 8 skipped**, mypy over 465 files,
`lint-imports` 9 kept / 0 broken over 177 analysed files. A five-plant sweep is
small because the change is a *move* — the real proof that nothing was lost is
`inspect.getsource` of all 38 public objects compared byte for byte against
`git show HEAD:src/usher/ports/repository.py`, not a mutation.

| plant | `ruff check` | `format --check` | `mypy` | `lint-imports` | `pytest tests/unit` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 `"TitleRepository"` deleted from `__init__.__all__` | **rc=1 `F401`** | PASS | **rc=1** ×99 | PASS | **1 failed** |
| P2 `_results.py` inverted into `bulk.py` | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | **1 failed** |
| C1 two independent dataclasses swapped in `bulk.py` | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| C2 two independent import blocks reordered in `__init__.py` | **rc=1 `I001`** | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |
| C3 one sentence of `title.py`'s module docstring reworded | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

**Both targets falsified the plan's own prediction about which check catches
them, in opposite directions, and that is the whole yield of the sweep.**

- **P1 was predicted to fail "the mirror case and mypy". The mirror case does
  not fail** — `test_every_postgres_repository_module_has_a_port_module_of_the_
  same_name` reads `port.__module__`, which a missing `__all__` entry does not
  move. What fails is `test_the_package_re_exports_every_public_object_its_
  modules_declare`, which is in the file for exactly this and would not be there
  if the prediction had been believed. mypy fails as predicted, at all 99 call
  sites (`Module "usher.ports.repository" does not explicitly export attribute`),
  and `ruff` fails too, on the now-unused import — the careless spelling.
- **P2 was predicted to "raise at load time as a cycle". It does not raise at
  all**, and the plan's own risk paragraph one page later says so (*"resolves
  today and drags the bulk port into every consumer tomorrow"*) — two sentences
  in one document predicting opposite outcomes, of which the sweep settles the
  pessimistic one. Moving `BulkWriteResult` out of the private `_results.py` into
  `bulk.py` and re-pointing its five other consumers there passes **ruff, format,
  mypy and all nine import contracts**; the only thing in the repository that
  sees it is `test_no_aggregate_module_imports_another_aggregate_module`, and the
  damage it prevents is architectural rather than a failure — five aggregates
  importing the bulk-load port for a two-field dataclass. **A structural
  invariant with no runtime symptom needs a structural test, and "it would be a
  cycle" is the reasoning that stops one being written.**
- **C2 is the control the plan names and it is not a gate control**, for the
  reason the `__all__`-reorder entry above records: `I` is in `[tool.ruff.lint]
  select`, so an import reorder is `I001`. It remains a valid control *on the
  suite* (pytest cannot kill it, which is what proves the harness is not scoring
  every run as a kill) and the write-up has to say "survived the suite", never
  "nothing catches it". **C1 and C3 are the two that pass all five**, and C1's
  equivalence is a fact about the code rather than about what the tools look at:
  `GenomeWriteResult` and `GenomeCoverage` are `@dataclass` bodies that reference
  neither each other nor anything defined between them, and no module in this
  package has an import-time side effect. C3 was checked first against the
  docstring-scan grep this file records — the ten test files it finds scan
  `ports/embedding.py`, `ports/metadata.py`, `services/` and `api/`, and **none
  of them scans `ports/repository`**.

**M9 Task E1's sweep: 4 plants over `RowProviderSettingsRepository` and its two
implementations — 4 killed, 1 equivalent-mutant control surviving as designed,
0 unintended survivors, 0 BAD-ANCHOR, 0 BROKEN-MUTATION, 0 DID-NOT-RUN.** Run
2026-08-11 in place, with the plant list and its expected verdict written down
first (this port's own acceptance section names all four), the three `.pyc`
defences in force throughout (`__pycache__` swept before every run,
`PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`, an equivalent-mutant control), and every restore
verified by `md5sum` against a pre-plant digest of both mutated files. First
run of this sweep produced a result with no durable record — reported in a
chat message, nothing in this file, nothing in the commit — which is the
defect this entry repairs, not a second measurement of a different port.

**Selection, stated because a survivor list is only true of the selection it
was measured against:** `tests/unit/test_row_provider_settings_repository_
contract.py` (the fake arm), `tests/integration/test_row_provider_settings_
repository.py` (the Postgres arm, plus its two Postgres-only cases),
`tests/unit/test_ports.py` (`ALL_PORTS` registration),
`tests/unit/test_ports_repository_package.py` (A1's mirror invariant — this
task adds a module to that package), `tests/unit/test_rows_invariants.py` and
`tests/unit/test_services_home.py` (the registry's slug-prefix distinctness,
pinned from both sides). Scoped rather than whole-suite because nothing
outside this task's own six files imports `RowProviderSettingsRepository` yet
— grepped before scoping, not assumed — so a defect in either implementation
has no path to collateral anywhere else in the tree; the route that will
change that is E2, not yet landed. Baseline green on a clean tree first: **220
passed in 5.19s**, restored to the identical count after every plant and
after the sweep.

The four plants, each the acceptance section's own words:

| plant | verdict | cases failed |
|---|---|---|
| `ON CONFLICT (slug_prefix) DO UPDATE` deleted from `_SET_ENABLED` (Postgres) | KILLED | 3 — `IntegrityError` on `pk_row_provider_settings`, a re-set slug now a duplicate key rather than an update |
| fake `overrides()` defaults every known slug to `True` rather than omitting the untouched ones | KILLED | 5 — the whole fake-arm contract, since every case reads through `overrides()` |
| `enabled` sense inverted in `set_enabled`, fake arm | KILLED | 3 |
| `enabled` sense inverted in `set_enabled`, Postgres arm | KILLED | 3 |
| `set_enabled` calls `self._session.commit()` (Postgres) | KILLED | 1 — the new second-session case, `assert 1 == 0` |

(Five rows because "the `enabled` sense inverted" was run on both
implementations independently, each with its own `set_enabled`; the
acceptance section names the property once and it is checked once per arm.)
Every kill was checked against the case it names and nothing else — the
`DO UPDATE` deletion raises before a row count is reachable, which is the
louder failure the contract's own upsert case is written to produce rather
than a silent duplicate.

**The control, measured against every gate step rather than against pytest
alone** — the check the `__all__`-reorder entry above exists to force:

| control | `pytest` (scoped selection) | `ruff check` | `ruff format --check` | `mypy src tests` | `lint-imports` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`'s two independent `SET` assignments swapped (`updated_at`/`enabled`) | PASS (220) | PASS | PASS | PASS | PASS |

It is a fact about the code rather than about what the tools look at: both
right-hand sides read only from `excluded`, which is fixed within the
statement before either assignment runs, and Postgres's `SET` list is
simultaneous rather than sequential — there is no intermediate state either
assignment could observe the other through. Already checked independently
against a real pgvector/pgvector:pg17 container by a reviewer before this
entry was written; re-measured here per gate step rather than re-argued.

Gate green before and after, on the fully restored tree: `ruff check`,
`ruff format --check`, `mypy` over 471 files, `lint-imports` 9 kept / 0
broken, and the whole-suite baseline unchanged at **2,995 unit / 4 skipped**.
