# IMDb, TMDb id exports, Wikidata and MovieLens

Verified facts, loaded when working in this subsystem. Measured or observed,
never assumed — each entry carries its date, its sample and what it refuted.
The always-on conventions live in `CLAUDE.md`; this file is the evidence.

**`links.csv`'s `tmdbId` is NOT unique — 162 duplicate rows over 38 ids —
while `imdbId` is.** So the genome joins `titles` through
`'tt' || lpad(imdbId, 7, '0')` and **never** through `tmdbId`: a `tmdbId` join
fans one TMDb id out across several MovieLens movies and attaches one film's
genome vector to another's title, on ids that are all real. The `lpad` is the
second half and is not decoration — over all 86,537 rows `imdbId` is 7
characters wide on 79,978 and 8 on 6,559, never shorter and never empty, so
`'tt' || imdbId` happens to be correct *today* while silently depending on a
padding convention the file documents nowhere, and one unpadded row would join
to nothing rather than raise. Same family as M4's 11-of-885 bare-digit `Imdb`
values.
**`genome-scores.csv`'s physical grouping is a property of the snapshot, not a
promise, and the importer verifies it.** 16,376 contiguous `movieId` runs,
strictly increasing, every run exactly 1,128 rows with `tagId` 1…1128 — which
is what makes a single-pass streaming importer possible without buffering an
18.5M-row matrix. A run of the wrong length, a duplicate `tagId` within a run,
or a `movieId` that reappears after its run closed is a **hard failure naming
the offending `movieId`**. What is deliberately *not* enforced is `tagId` ordering
*within* a run: the vector is built by index rather than by append, and the
case that proves that shuffles a run and expects the right vector — so
enforcing the observed order would make the by-index property unprovable. The
run check is `len(run) == n and |{tagIds}| == n`.
**`genome-tags.csv` is 1,128 rows and every one of them is usable, measured
2026-08-07 through the shipped `CachedDatasetFile.member_lines`.** `tagId` is
exactly `1...1128` and already ascending; every name is non-empty; **no name
contains a comma**; all 1,128 are distinct; the longest is 65 characters; and
the member is **CRLF**-terminated (8,359 compressed / 18,103 uncompressed
bytes). Two of those matter to the parser. The CRLF is invisible because
`member_lines` decodes through `io.TextIOWrapper` in universal-newline mode,
so the `\r` is gone before `rstrip("\n")` runs -- **verified by reading, not
assumed**, since a stray `\r` would land in every stored tag name. And the
comma-free names are a property of *this snapshot*, not a promise, which is
why the parse is `partition(",")` rather than the `csv` module: only the first
comma separates. `partition` rather than `split(",", 1)` because a row with no
comma at all has to be distinguishable, and `split` hands that back as a
one-element list whose `[0]` parses as a perfectly good `tagId` -- the shipped
`_tag_count` read exactly that field and was blind to it, which was harmless
while the names were being thrown away and is not now that `m08b` stores them.

**Two follow-ups from the review of that measurement, 2026-08-07.** The
universal-newline property was asserted in *three* source files and covered by
no test — every fixture in `tests/unit/test_adapters_bulk_movielens.py` is
built with `"\n".join(...)`, so `newline=""` on that `TextIOWrapper` passed all
2,882 unit cases while putting a trailing `\r` on all 1,128 stored names.
`test_a_crlf_bodied_member_stores_no_carriage_return_in_a_tag_name` is the
CRLF-bodied fixture that closes it, and it is the only case in the suite that
fails against that plant. And the empty-name refusal is now `not name.strip()`,
not `not name`: `ck_genome_tags_tag_not_empty` is `tag <> ''`, which accepts
`'   '`, so before the parser was tightened a whitespace-only lane would have
been stored by both layers. Unreachable in the measured file (all 1,128 names
are `strip()`-stable), which is why the CHECK was left alone rather than
re-spelled `btrim(tag) <> ''` in a migration for a value nothing can produce.

**`ml-32m` has no genome and `ml-25m` may not be redistributed, so `ml-latest`
is forced rather than preferred.** `ml-32m.zip` (05/2024) is the newest full
release and dropped the genome entirely — four members only. `ml-25m` has one
and is the only genome-bearing archive whose licence says *"the user may not
redistribute the data without separate permission."* `ml-latest` has a genome
**and** the permissive clause. Three of PRD 04's numbers were wrong on the
strength of the archive confusion: **18,472,128** relevance scores (not
"15.6M"), **334.6 MiB** (not "250 MiB" — that is `ml-25m`'s size, the right
number for the wrong archive, which is why it survived review), and **16,376**
movies (not 13,816). The 1,128 tags was exactly right. **Measured, `ml-latest`
has not moved in three years** (`Last-Modified: Thu, 20 Jul 2023 20:20:32 GMT`)
despite its own README calling it a *development* dataset — the same
`CachedDatasetFile` hazard shape as IMDb's daily regeneration, opposite
conclusion. Range-fetching only the three members the importer reads (~96 MB of
335 MB) is possible and was **measured and declined**: re-implementing resume,
`If-Range` and the stale-snapshot interlock against per-member local headers is
new failure surface for a saving an operator pays once.
**The bootstrap that produced the catalog, and a cache finding with it.**
74.8 s wall clock end to end (`title.basics` 41.6 s → 1,271,138 rows,
`title.ratings` 22.2 s → 538,937 rows written, suspended-index rebuild
10.9 s), 899,828 movies / 371,310 series, `titles` at 928 MB total relation
size and the database at 937 MB. **Nothing was re-downloaded — but only
because the run pinned the snapshot, and the shipped path would have
re-downloaded.** `CachedDatasetFile.ensure_local` short-circuits on
`path.exists() and stamp.read_text() == revision`, where `revision` is what
`revision()` resolved *this run* from a `HEAD`. IMDb regenerates
`title.basics.tsv.gz` daily, so four days after the cache was filled the
upstream ETag had moved and `bootstrap --phase imdb` would have fetched
224 MB and imported a *different* snapshot. Pinning `revision()` to the
sidecar's own value made the import read the cached bytes: NIC counters moved
**1.2 MB** across the whole bootstrap and `data/bulk` was byte-identical
before and after. **"The dumps are on disk, so nothing re-downloads" is false
as stated** — the cache is keyed on the upstream token, not on local
presence.
**IMDb TSVs have no quoting mechanism** and their title fields contain
literal `"` (21 in the first 553,395 rows of `title.basics.tsv.gz`).
`csv.reader`'s default `QUOTE_MINIMAL` silently strips them — verified. Parse
with `line.split("\t")`.
**Wikidata's crosswalk is seconds, not an hour.** The three property joins
measured 14.5 s / 2.1 s / 1.1 s unchunked. WDQS's timeout surfaces as
`HTTP 504 text/plain "upstream request timeout"` after ~65 s with no
`Retry-After`. A live end-to-end run stored 336,200 pairs.
**Suspending `ix_titles_sort_name`/`ix_titles_name_lower_year` during Phase 0
is a real, if modest, win — kept, not emptied.** Measured 2026-07-30 against
the live `title.basics.tsv.gz` (1,271,138 retained titles): 35.8 s suspended
vs 40.2 s kept (11.0% faster), and the rebuilt pair is ~24% smaller (97 MB
vs 127 MB) than building them incrementally across the same load. Only
applies to a first bootstrap (`bulk_load_window` declines on a non-empty
`titles`), so the saving costs nothing when it doesn't apply. See PRD 04's
Phase 0 section for the full numbers.
**`PostgresImportRunRepository.save()` must roll back on a caught
`IntegrityError`, not just translate it.** Without the rollback, Postgres
leaves the *session* — not just the failed call — with an aborted
transaction, so the very next statement on it raises `sqlalchemy.exc.
PendingRollbackError` instead of running. `BootstrapService.import_dataset`'s
except handler is exactly such a next statement, so the missing rollback
broke its documented "does not re-raise" contract for real, verified against
real Postgres with two engine-bound sessions racing to bootstrap the same
dataset (`tests/integration/test_import_run_repository.py`). Deliberately a
full `session.rollback()`, not a `PostgresTitleRepository`-style SAVEPOINT —
see `usher/db/repositories/import_run.py`'s module docstring for why this
repository's one caller never has independent pending work on the session
worth a SAVEPOINT protecting.
**Fixing that session-poisoning bug surfaced a second one, one layer up, in
`BootstrapService.import_dataset` itself: the loser's failure handler
overwrote the winner's checkpoint.** Once `self._runs.get(dataset.name)`
after a caught `RepositoryConflict` stopped raising and started actually
returning a row, it returns the *other*, winning process's row — the loser
never got one of its own (`start()` never returned it one). The except
handler used to re-fetch by dataset name unconditionally and evolve+save
`FAILED` onto whatever it found, which is correct when that row is the
caller's own (a `_drain` failure, after `start()` succeeded) but silently
corrupts a legitimately `RUNNING` or already-`COMPLETED` import when it
belongs to someone else (a `start()` conflict) — worse than the crash it
replaced, because the crash was loud and this would not have been: a
subsequent resume reads exactly that corrupted record. `RepositoryConflict`
can only ever reach `import_dataset` from `start()` itself — once any row
exists for a dataset, every later `start()`/`save()` call updates that same
row rather than competing for a new one, so `_drain`'s own `save()` calls
(which always update the id `start()` already returned) cannot trigger it.
That made the fix a clean split: a `RepositoryConflict` from `start()`
specifically now goes to `_concede_to_other_owner`, which touches nothing
(no `save`, no `commit`) and returns the current owner's row exactly as
stored; every other `UsherPortError` path is unchanged. Verified against
real Postgres with a forced two-session race
(`tests/integration/test_bootstrap_concurrency.py`) — reproduced the
overwrite on the pre-fix code first (the winner's row read back `FAILED`
with the loser's unrelated conflict message), then confirmed the fix
leaves it untouched. The unit-level fakes needed a matching fix to even be
capable of catching this: the original conflict test double raised
`RepositoryConflict` with no competing row present at all, so asserting
only "the caller didn't crash" passed both before and after either bug —
it needs a real winner row seeded first, and an assertion that it comes
back byte-for-byte unchanged.

Verified working as of M2's final group (end-to-end integration, the index
measurement, and documentation) — the bulk-dataset bootstrap pipeline is
runnable for real, not just under test:

```bash
export USHER_DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://usher:usher@localhost:5432/usher"
export USHER_SECRET_KEY="<32+ char secret>"
uv run python -m usher bootstrap --phase all       # import IMDb + TMDb ids + crosswalk
uv run python -m usher bootstrap --phase imdb      # one phase at a time
uv run python -m usher bootstrap-status            # progress and catalog size
uv run python scripts/measure_bulk_load.py         # NOT a test -- downloads the real dump
```

Verified directly against a scratch `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`, 2026-07-30,
downloading the real IMDb/TMDb dumps and querying live Wikidata — nothing
mocked. `bootstrap --phase imdb` killed mid-run at 700,000/1,271,138 titles
committed; re-run logged `resuming imdb.title.basics from position 6033908
(700000 rows already seen)` and finished at the identical 1,271,138 titles
an uninterrupted run reaches. A full `bootstrap --phase all` then ran end to
end: 1,271,138 titles (899,828 movies / 371,310 series), 538,937 with a
community rating, 291,737 linked to a `tmdb_id` (236,712 movies / 55,025
series, zero `(tmdb_id, kind)` duplicates — ADR-0011 holds under real data),
50,793 linked to a `tvdb_id`. Two known titles spot-checked correct end to
end: `tt0111161` (The Shawshank Redemption) landed with `tmdb_id=278`,
`community_rating=9.3`; `tt0944947` (Game of Thrones) landed with
`tmdb_id=1399`, `tvdb_id=121361`, `community_rating=9.2`. `bootstrap-status`'s
final report:

```text
titles in catalog: 1271138
wikidata.crosswalk       completed  position=30 seen=386364 written=385805
tmdb.ids.series          completed  position=228100 seen=228100 written=228100

```

**A live end-to-end run needs a real catalog, and building one costs three
minutes and no API key.** `bootstrap --phase all` pulls IMDb's
`title.basics`/`title.ratings` dumps, TMDb's *public daily id export files*
(not the API — no key), and Wikidata's public SPARQL endpoint. Re-run
2026-07-31 against a scratch `pgvector/pgvector:pg17`: **1,271,314 titles,
291,772 with a `tmdb_id`, 539,006 with a community rating**, in 2 min 59 s
wall clock end to end. That is the catalog M4's match ladder has to be
measured against — an empty one sends everything to tier 5 and measures
nothing.
