    """Persistence for canonical titles, kept behind a port so services
    depend on this ABC and never on `usher.db` directly — see ADR-0009.
    `usher.db.repositories.title.PostgresTitleRepository` is the concrete,
    SQLAlchemy-backed implementation; `api/`, the composition root,
    constructs it and injects it into services.

    Every method below shares one session-wide precondition, not just
    advice to whoever implements this port: **the session must carry no
    unflushed, invalid state when any method here is called.** A
    SQL-backed implementation's session typically autoflushes by default,
    so even a pure read can trigger a write — and once more than one
    repository shares a session (from the milestone that adds
    `MediaItemRepository`/`WatchStateRepository`), "nothing else pending is
    broken" stops being a safe assumption to make on this port's behalf.
    `PostgresTitleRepository`'s reads defensively suppress autoflush for
    exactly this reason (see its module docstring), but that is a backstop
    inside one implementation, not a substitute for callers upholding the
    precondition: a caller that leaves invalid state pending across a
    repository boundary can still surface a raw storage exception the next
    time *anything* on that session flushes it, including code this port
    doesn't own.

    Bulk loading deliberately bypasses this port. Measured cost of going
    through it: ~3 statements and ~1.15 ms per `add()` (SAVEPOINT / INSERT
    / RELEASE) against `PostgresTitleRepository` — roughly 4 hours of pure
    repository overhead at M2's ~12.7M skeleton rows, before a single row
    of actual bulk-dataset I/O. `TitleRow`'s server-defaults already exist
    so a raw `COPY` can omit any column it doesn't have data for; M2's bulk
    loader is expected to use that path directly, not this one.
