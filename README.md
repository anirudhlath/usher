# Usher

A self-hosted media catalog backend. Usher maintains its own canonical database
of film and television, treats media servers (Emby first) as interchangeable
*sources* that answer "where can this be played?", and exposes an API rich
enough to build a full media browser against.

Design documentation lives in [`docs/prd/`](docs/prd/README.md).

## Status

Pre-release. Milestone M1 (foundation) in progress — see
[`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/).

## Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose
- A [TMDb API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) (free, non-commercial)

## Attribution

This project ships importers, never data. Each deployment downloads its own
datasets and holds its own API keys.
